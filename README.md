Employee record management system (ERMS) built with Python-Flask and MySQL is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage and track employee data within an organization.

## *Task 1.* Database Setup :
$ nano setup_db.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server mysql-client -y
sudo systemctl start mysql

sudo mysql -u root <<EOF
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'apk'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '@1111';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'apk'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS employee;
USE employee;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employee (
    empid VARCHAR(20),
    fname VARCHAR(20),
    lname VARCHAR(20),
    pri_skill VARCHAR(20),
    location VARCHAR(20)
);
EOF
```
### Varify

```bash
sudo mysql -u root
show databases;
use employee;
show tables;
DESCRIBE employee;
SELECT * FROM employee LIMIT 10;
```

## *Task 2.* Dockerize App Setup:
### Step 1: Clone/Fork the repository to make use of it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xrootms/Dockerize-Flask-App-With-Logging.git

cd Dockerize-Flask-App-With-Logging
cat EmpApp.py
```

### Step 2: Create a requirements.txt file in the project directory.

**nano requirements.txt**

```bash
flask
pymysql
boto3
gunicorn
cryptograph
```
### Dockerfile Explanation.

**cat Dockerfile**

|1.	Python Slim                                  | # Its base image. Which is a minimal image.
|2.	ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1                | # Smaller container size and Cleaner fs
|3.	ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1                       | # Forces stdout/stderr streams to be unbuffered, Real- time logs
|4.	/app                                         | # Set the /app directory as the working directory.
|5.	&&                                           | # Combining RUNs commands (which means smaller image.)
|6.	--no-install-recommends                      | # keeps the image smaller by avoiding extra suggested packages
|7.	rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*                  | # To keep image size small: clean the apt cache in the same layer
|8.	python -m pip                                | # use the correct pip for this Python (avoid mismatch)
|9.	--no-cache-dir                               | # Pip will NOT save downloaded files in the cache, images smaller 
|10.	-r                                       | # Tells pip to install dependencies from a file
|11.	CMD                                      | # Default command that runs when the container starts.
|12.	"--access-logfile", "-"                  | # Send access logs to stdout
|13.	"--error-logfile", "-"                   | # Send error logs to stderr
|14.	"EmpApp:app"                             | # Import app object from EmpApp.py
|15.	 USER appuser                            | # Run application as a non-root user called appuser.”


### Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t <image-name> .
```
### Run the Docker Image
```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000  -- name <container-name>  <image-name> .
```
Now, check your application on the browser using <ip:5000>

# Optimizing Docker Images
Optimizing Docker images is very important. We can use **SlimToolkit** to reduce the size of your  Docker image.
- **Install SlimToolkit :**
  
```bash
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slimtoolkit/slim/master/scripts/install-slim.sh | sudo bash
```

Reload your shell & Verify:

```bash
exec bash
slim –version
```

Create a File preserved-paths.txt  with the file name or file path you don’t want to get removed during the slim process.

#nano preserved-paths.txt 

```bash
 /app
/usr/local/bin/python3
/usr/local/bin/flask
```

Run your command

```bash
slim build \
  --http-probe=false \
  --preserve-path-file preserved-paths.txt \
  --tag slimmed-emp-srl04-flask-app \ 
emp-srl04-flask-app
```

This command will slim the Docker images without affecting the file or file path mentioned in the txt file with a new name you specify in the --tag flag.

**Now if you you check the docker image size, it will be considerably reduced as shown below.**

image<img src="./image/18499070.gif" alt="LEMP Diagram" width="200" align="right" />

You can see the size of the Docker image has been reduced from 106MB to 19.8MB and it works properly without any issue.

# Docker Log Management

### What is the CloudWatch Agent?
The CloudWatch Agent is an official AWS service/daemon that runs on your server and can:

-	collect log files.
-	collect system metrics (CPU, RAM, disk, network).
-	send them securely to CloudWatch.

In Docker environments, it is often used to:
-	Read container log files from: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log
-	Forward them to CloudWatch Logs

## Step 1: Create IAM role
Attach this policy to EC2: 

**CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy**                          (EC2 role with CloudWatch permissions)

## Step 2: Install CloudWatch Agent on host
On Ubuntu:

```bash
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/ubuntu/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb

sudo dpkg -i amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
```

## Step 3: Create agent configuration
Run the wizard (easy way):

```bash
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard
```

When asked:
-	OS :> linux
-	user :> root
-	Logs :> yes
-	Log file path :> /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log
-	Log group :> docker-container-flask-logs
-	Log stream :> {instance_id}
-	Metrics :> yes (recommended)

This creates a config file like:
-	/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json

## Step 4: Start the agent

```bash
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl \
  -a fetch-config \
  -m ec2 \
  -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json \
  -s
```

**Check status:**

```bash
sudo systemctl status amazon-cloudwatch-agent
```

## Step 5: Verify
1.	Go to AWS Console :> CloudWatch → Logs
2.	We will see log group:   (docker-container-flask-logs)
3.	Logs update LIVE
Container logs are now centralized.

image<img src="./image/18499070.gif" alt="LEMP Diagram" width="200" align="right" />


**Result**
Now automatically:
all Docker container logs appear in CloudWatch Logs
Log group: emp-srl-app
Log streams: EC2 instance IDs
